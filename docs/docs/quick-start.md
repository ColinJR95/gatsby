title: Quick Start
---

This quick start is intended for intermediate to advanced developers. For a gentler intro to Gatsby, [head to our tutorial](/tutorial/)!

## Getting started with Gatsby

1. Create a new site

```shell
npm init gatsby
```

Follow the prompts to choose your preferred CMS, styling tools and additional features.

2. Change directories into the site folder you created in step 1. 

```shell
cd gatsby-site
```

3. Start development server

```shell
gatsby develop
```

Gatsby will start a hot-reloading development environment accessible by default at `http://localhost:8000`.

4. Now you're ready to make changes to your site!

Try editing the home page in `src/pages/index.js`. Saved changes will live reload in the browser.

## What's next?

### Add more features

[Install and configure additional plugins](/docs/recipes/) to quickly add additional functionality to your site.

### Deploy your site

Try using [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/cloud/) to build and deploy your site to one of many hosting providers.
